# RabbitMQ Check

# Overview

The RabbitMQ check lets you:

* Track queue-based stats: queue size, consumer count, unacknowledged messages, redelivered messages, etc
* Track node-based stats: waiting processes, used sockets, used file descriptors, etc
* Monitor vhosts for aliveness and number of connections

And more.

# Installation

The rabbitmq check can be installed with your package manager, [instructions are available on our support site](https://support.serverdensity.com/hc/en-us/search?query=rabbitmq).

# Configuration

### Prepare RabbitMQ

You must enable the RabbitMQ management plugin. See [RabbitMQ's documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html) to enable it.

### Connect the Agent

Create a file `rabbitmq.yaml` in the Agent's `conf.d` directory:

```
init_config:

instances:
  - rabbitmq_api_url: http://localhost:15672/api/
#   rabbitmq_user: <RABBIT_USER> # if your rabbitmq API requires auth; default is guest
#   rabbitmq_pass: <RABBIT_PASS> # default is guest
#   tag_families: true           # default is false
#   vhosts:
#     - <THE_ONE_VHOST_YOU_CARE_ABOUT>
```

If you don't set `vhosts`, the Agent sends the following for EVERY vhost:

1. the `rabbitmq.aliveness` service check
1. the `rabbitmq.connections` metric

If you do set `vhosts`, the Agent sends this check and metric only for the vhosts you list.

There are options for `queues` and `nodes` that work similarlyâ€”the Agent checks all queues and nodes by default, but you can provide lists or regexes to limit this. See the [example check configuration](conf.yaml.example) for details on these configuration options (and all others).

Restart the Agent to begin sending RabbitMQ metrics to Server Density.

# Validation

Run the Agent's `info` subcommand and look for `rabbitmq` under the Checks section:

```
  Checks
  ======
    [...]

    rabbitmq
    -------
      - instance #0 [OK]
      - Collected 26 metrics, 0 events & 2 service checks

    [...]
```

# Compatibility

The rabbitmq check is compatible with all major platforms.

# Metrics

See [metadata.csv](metadata.csv) for a list of metrics provided by this check.

The Agent tags `rabbitmq.queue.*` metrics by queue name, and `rabbitmq.node.*` metrics by node name.
